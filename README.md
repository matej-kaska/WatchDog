# WatchDog

WatchDog is a simple application designed to monitor the availability of websites by periodically sending requests to servers. Users can add websites and obtain detailed information about their availability, including a timeline graph, returned IP addresses, and server response status codes. The application also allows for verifying the availability and responsiveness of a server for a specific IP address of a website. The software aims to provide users with an overview of their website's availability and information about any potential outages.

### Watched Website üìñ

This website page within the WatchDog application provides users with detailed information about a specific website in a comprehensive and organized manner. This page offers valuable insights into the website's availability, including a graphical representation of its uptime status, a list of IP addresses that have responded to requests from the domain, along with their corresponding status codes, and the date and time of the last check.

At the top of the website page, users will find a visually informative graph that depicts the website's availability over a period of time. This graph allows users to easily track any patterns or fluctuations in the website's uptime, providing a clear overview of its overall performance. By analyzing the graph, users can quickly identify periods of downtime or interruptions and take appropriate actions to rectify any issues.

Beneath the graph, the website page displays a list of IP addresses that have responded to requests from the domain. Each IP address entry is accompanied by its corresponding status code, indicating the server's response status (e.g., 200 for a successful response, 404 for page not found, etc.). This list provides users with a comprehensive overview of the different servers for that website, offering insights into potential network or routing issues.
